# Assignment 2 - Algorithms & Parallel Computing in C++ 2024  

This repository contains the implementation of **Assignment 2** for the Advanced Programming Concepts (APC) course, November 2024. The assignment focuses on implementing key components of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** in C++, including layers such as convolutional, max pooling, and fully connected layers.  

## Project Structure  

- **`matrix` Class**: Provides matrix operations including initialization, dot product, and printing.
- **`tensor_3d` Class**: Handles 3D tensor manipulations, including element-wise operations and scaling.  
- **`feature_layer` Base Class**: Abstract class for feature extraction layers, including convolution and pooling.  
- **`cnn` Class**: Implements a simple CNN architecture for digit recognition using the LeNet model.  

## Key Features  

- **Class: Convolutional Layer**  
   - `tensor_3d evaluate(const tensor_3d& input)`  
     Performs the convolution of the input with the convolutional filter as described in Equation 4.  
   - `tensor_3d forward_pass(const tensor_3d& inputs)`  
     Performs a forward pass of the layer with the input. The output is obtained after applying the activation function to the result of the `evaluate` function.  

- **Class: Max Pooling Layer**  
   - `tensor_3d evaluate(const tensor_3d& input)`  
     Performs the max pooling operation on the input using the pooling filter as described in Equation 7.  
   - `tensor_3d forward_pass(const tensor_3d& inputs)`  
     Executes a forward pass of the layer with the input. The output is obtained after applying the activation function to the result of the `evaluate` function.  

- **Class: Fully Connected (FC) Layer**  
   - `std::vector<double> compute(const std::vector<double>& inputs)`  
     Computes the weighted sum of the inputs with the layer weights, returning the raw output (without activation). Implements Equation 1. For simplicity, the bias term \( b \) is set to 0.  
   - `std::vector<double> forward_pass(const std::vector<double>& inputs)`  
     Executes a forward pass through the layer by applying weights and the activation function to the input vector, returning the output vector.  

- **LeNet Architecture**  
   Processes MNIST-like images to recognize handwritten digits using convolutional, max pooling, and fully connected layers.   

## Testing  

The repository includes seven predefined tests (`test1()` through `test7()`) in the `main.cpp` file.  
- Uncomment specific tests in `main()` to validate individual components.  
- Tests are incremental; ensure all dependencies are resolved before proceeding to higher tests.  

## How to Run  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone <repo-url>  
   cd <repo-name>  
   ```  

2. Compile the project using your preferred C++ compiler:  
   ```bash  
   g++ -o Assignment2 main.cpp -std=c++17  
   ```  

3. Run the compiled program:  
   ```bash  
   ./Assignment2  
   ```  

4. Ensure output matches expected results for all test cases.
