## What is this repository ?

This repository is linked to the course **Algorithms and Parallel Computing in C++** I am currently following (first semester of academic year 2024/2025). This is part of my **MSc Mathematical Engineering** from Politecnico di Milano. I will push some projects I worked on during this course. First you will find some C++ pieces of code and then some pieces of code related to parallel computing.

  - ⁠Classes & Constructors
  - ⁠Complexity of Algorithms
  - ⁠Destructor. Copy constructor
  - ⁠Streams
  - ⁠Inheritance & Polymorphism
  - ⁠Smart pointers
  - ⁠Overloading method and operators
  - ⁠Template functions and template classes⁠
  - STL
- Parallel Programming:
  - ⁠Introduction to Parallel Programming
  - ⁠Flynn’s taxonomy
  - Performance and speedup MPI
- Introduction to MPI :
