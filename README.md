# CPP_APC repository :
This repository is linked to the course $\textbf{"Algorithms and Parallel Computing in C++"}$ I am currently following (first semester of academic year 2024/2025). This is part of my MSc Mathematical Engineering from Politecnico di Milano. I will push some projects I worked on during this course. First you will find some C++ pieces of code and then some pieces of code related to parallel computing.

## Program of this course :
This is the main site of the course “Algorithms and Parallel Computing”  (Mathematical Engineering students A-M, Nuclear Engineering students) that will be held at Politecnico di Milano from September to December 2024.

This is a 10-credit course for graduate students.
